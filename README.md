## Using Webpack, React, and Babel

Once you get the packages declared on package.json via npm install, 
you need to run the command: "npm run dev:hot" and go to http://localhost:7700/dist in your browser.

Flux approach using actions, dispatcher and store, retriving data from openlibrary api using axios.

Why Babel? To browser support JSX syntax and ECMAScript6.<br/>
Webpack its like a Grunt or Gulp and works fine with React, and supports loaders to preprocces files.
