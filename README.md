# Webpack, React, and Babel boilerplate

Once you get the packages declared on package.json via npm install, 
you need to generate the bundle linked in the html. For this you can run the command: npm run build (added on the package.json scripts).

Why Babel? To browser support JSX syntax and ECMAScript6.<br/>
Webpack its like a Grunt or Gulp and works fine with React, and supports loaders to preprocces files.
